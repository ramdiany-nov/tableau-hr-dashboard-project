# 👥 Tableau HR Analytics Dashboard Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Human Resources Analytics Dashboard** designed to help HR teams monitor workforce metrics, understand employee demographics, and analyse compensation patterns.

The dashboard provides both a **high-level summary view** for strategic insights and a **detailed employee records view** for operational analysis, enabling data-driven HR decision-making.

## 🧩 Business Problem
HR teams often manage large volumes of employee data across departments, locations, and roles. Without structured visual analysis, it becomes difficult to identify workforce trends, monitor employee lifecycle metrics, and evaluate compensation fairness.

This project transforms raw employee data into an interactive dashboard that helps:

- Monitor hiring and termination trends  
- Understand workforce composition  
- Analyse salary patterns  
- Identify demographic insights  
- Support strategic HR planning
